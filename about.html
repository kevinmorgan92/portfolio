                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>
                            I'm a dedicated and enthusiastic computer science student, currently 31 years old, pursuing my education at the
                            University of Ulster. My journey in the field of technology has been fueled by my unwavering passion for web design and
                            coding. I find immense joy in creating captivating and user-friendly websites that bring ideas to life. Beyond the realm
                            of coding, I have a thirst for exploration and adventure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Traveling has not only broadened my horizons but has also
                            provided me with valuable opportunities to meet new people and learn from their diverse perspectives. As an avid
                            learner, I am constantly seeking ways to enhance my skills and stay updated with the latest advancements in the
                            industry. Join me on this exciting journey as I push boundaries, embrace challenges, and continue to evolve as a skilled
                            professional in the ever-evolving world of technology.
                        </p>
                        <h2>My History</h2>
                        <p>
                            I embarked on a transformative journey that took me to Canada, where I resided for two
                            enriching years. It was during this time that I truly grasped the invaluable benefits of broadening one's horizons. I
                            embraced the opportunity to work in an outdoor retail store, where I started as a sales assistant and eventually earned a
                            supervisor role. Interacting with diverse product knowledge representatives from various brands, I honed my skills in
                            building professional relationships. My time in Canada laid the foundation for my growth as a professional and instilled
                            in me the importance of open-mindedness.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            Following my Canadian experience, I set my sights on Japan, where I resided for another two-year period.
                            During this time, I delved into the role of an English teacher, where I encountered students of all ages and
                            backgrounds. Problem-solving became second nature as I tailored my teaching methods to suit the unique needs of each
                            individual and taught me the importance of adapting to different learning styles.
                            Living within a different culture served as a constant reminder of the limitless possibilities for personal
                            growth and intellectual expansion.
                        </p>
                        <h2>My Future Ambition</h2>
                        <p>
                            My goal is to become an integral part of an exciting and innovative team. I believe that collaboration is key to
                            unlocking breakthroughs in technology. By surrounding myself with like-minded individuals who are passionate about
                            pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo, I can continually learn and contribute to cutting-edge projects. I
                            yearn to be part of a team that embraces creativity, collaboration, and a shared vision to create transformative
                            solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Ultimately, my ambitions for the future are driven by a desire for personal growth, professional excellence, and a
                            commitment to making a positive impact through technology. With unwavering determination and a hunger for knowledge, I
                            am eager to embark on this exciting journey, embracing the opportunities that lie ahead.
